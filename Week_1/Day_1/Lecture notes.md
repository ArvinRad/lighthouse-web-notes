## Tips:

Starting with:
```shell
Vagrant up 
```
To call the virtual machine
```shell
vagrant ssh 
```
To connect to LHL
The command above assumes that you're in the correct directory on your host machine (which should beÂ ~/lighthouse).

Use:

```shell
Pwd  
```
to show the directory
```shell
cd 
```
to change the directory
```shell
mkdir 
```
to create the directory.

We can copy a SSH URL of the gist so that you can clone it by:
```shell
git clone git@gist.github.com:YOUR_FORKS_ID.git <local folder name>
```
Then we can Initialize a new git repo in this directory by:
```shell
git init
```
Then we can add/update content to our repo by:
```shell
it add <. or file name>
git commit -m "your note on the commit here"
git push -u origin master
```

We can also pushing to GitHub after creating content through creating a repo and adding the URL of the new repo as a remote on your local repo by:
```shell
git remote add origin URL
```
